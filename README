OVERVIEW:

This README file is for the project

host.c: The program gets its input from a screen as two arguments. This program will 
	initialize all the semaphores and the host will fork new process which is the	
	philosopher process.The host program controls the start of the philosophers then it lays 
	down the table with the semaphores that is the chopstiks and then does all the clean up.


philosopher.c: The philosopher code opens the semaphore 
		for its left and right chopsticks  and then tries to pick up
		first the left one then the right one.Then in the loop it first tries to
		go in the hungry state then it tries to pickup the chopstick then after 
		that when it has picked up the left and the right chopsticks then it goes
		into the eating state.then it drops the left fork and then the right 
		fork and then goes to the thinking state.This is exactly what a philosopher 
		does.

	Please follow these Commands to execute the code:

	1. gcc -pthread philosopher.c -o philosopher
	2. gcc -pthread host.c -o host
	3. ./host [no. of philosophers] [no of Iterations]
	4. rm chopstickfilename*
